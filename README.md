# Weather data analysis and prediction
![Weather Forescasting](Weather_forecasting_Readme_Image.png)

## Description

This project uses statistical analysis and machine learning, specifically Ridge Regression to predict short term high and low temperatures based on weather data from May 1, 2023, to July 7, 2024.

The main features of the project include:

* **Temperature Prediction**: Uses historical weather data to predict future daily temperature highs and lows.
* **Data Analysis**: Analyzes patterns and trends in weather data to uncover key influencing factors.
* **Visualization**: Provides visual outputs showing predicted vs. actual temperature readings for better understanding and interpretation.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.10.12
* ipykernel - Version: 6.29.5
* pandas - Version: 2.2.2
* matplotlib - Version: 3.9.2
* seaborn - Version: 0.13.2
* statsmodels - Version: 0.14.2
* scikit-learn - Version: 1.5.1

**Note**: Ensure to use the specified library versions for compatibility. Users may need to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages.

## Data used
* Source: https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data
* Dataset: "Weather_data_2023_2024.csv"

## Usage instructions
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Laizra/Weather_prediction.git
cd Weather_prediction
```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Roadmap
I built this project with the predictive models as are in mind so this project is complete with no expected changes.
